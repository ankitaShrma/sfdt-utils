# sfdt-utils

`Util functions for working with SFDT objects`

Working with SFDT is hard and the JS API from SF provides us the basics to do that.

Here we have compiled a group of utils so that we can easily do some more advanced things.

## Usage:

Eg:

```
import processInlines from 'sfdt-utils/processInlines'
```

Note: this is why all the files are in the root folder (so we dont need a path for importing)

## API

### Process Inlines

...

### Populate

## To run tests:

```
 $ yarn test
```
